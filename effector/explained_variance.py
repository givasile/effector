"""Label-free explained variance — how much of the model an additive surrogate keeps.

The units contract puts `importance`/`heter_score` in output units; this module
adds the one denominator that turns the report into variance accounting:
`Var(f̂(X))`. Two surrogates are read off the fitted effect's cached curves —
zero extra model calls beyond the single `f̂(X)` pass — and scored as

    R² = 1 − E[(f̂ − g)²] / Var(f̂)

- the **GAM surrogate**: `g(x) = c + Σ_j centered global curve_j(x_j)`;
- the **regional (CALM) surrogate**: each partitioned feature's curve becomes
  leaf-conditional under *its own* partition (non-partitioned features keep
  their global curve), with the constant term fitted jointly by least squares
  on region-indicator dummies — the joint solve assigns each between-region
  mean shift once, so overlapping partitions cannot double-count it. The
  reported combined figure greedily selects which partitions to apply (see
  `summarize`), since overlapping partitions can also double-count interaction
  deviations inside the curves, which no offset fit can repair.

This is faithfulness/distillation only: no ground-truth labels ever (the
no-`y` constitution), and evaluation happens at the effect's own training
data, inside `axis_limits` by construction. R² can be negative (correlated
features make additive curves double-count shared variance) — it is reported
as-is, never clamped. The regional R² is not guaranteed ≥ the global one
(only offsets are least-squares-fitted, not the curves), though it is in
practice.

Curves are read through the model-free summary path (`_summary` →
`_eval_payload`, the same read `_importance` uses) — **not** `effect.eval`,
which on (d-)PDP grows the position store / retouches ICE with model calls.

This module is a **leaf**: numpy only; it duck-types the effect
(`._summary`/`._eval_payload`/`.data`/`.model`/`._y_pred`) and `Partition`
(`.leaves`/`.mask(idx)`, `leaf.rule.conditions`, and — for the ledger's
heterogeneity column — `part[0].heterogeneity`, `leaf.heterogeneity`,
`leaf.nof_instances`).

    double-count interaction deviations in the leaf-conditional curves, which
    the joint offsets cannot repair); the greedy pass guarantees
    `regional_r2 ≥ gam_r2` and mirrors `find_regions`' own greedy objective.

    "This means that the effect of $x_1$ on the output $y$ depends on the value of $x_2$ and vice versa.\n",
    "Therefore, there is no golden standard on how to split the effect of $f_{1,2}$ to two parts, one that corresponds to $x_1$ and one to $x_2$.\n",

    "In contrast, $x_3$ does not interact with any other feature, so its effect can be easily computed as $e^{x_3}$."
